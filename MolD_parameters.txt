#############SET TAXON PARAMETERS (NO DEFAULTS, no parameters entered will lead to an error).
#Set list of the focus taxa (enter a comma separated list WITHOUT SPACES)
#or if each taxon is to be diagnosed, enter 'ALL'
#or if all taxa with more than N sequences available (where N is a natural number), enter >N
qTAXA=

#Set taxon rank: if species - 1, if above species - 2.

#Code gaps as characters: 'yes' or 'no'

#############SET ADVANCED PARAMETERS FOR pDNC RECOVERY. If you don't want to set them, don't enter anything after '='
#Set number of the informative positions to be considered, integer (default 100)
#or use '>'+integer to set desired cutoff value (for example '>1')
Cutoff=

#Set how many ambiguously called nucleotides are allowed (default 5)
NumberN=

#Set number recursions of MolD (default 10000)
Number_of_iterations=

#Set maximum length for the raw pDNCs (defailt 12)
MaxLen1=

#Set maximum length for the refined pDNCs (default 7)
MaxLen2=

############ SET PARAMETERS OF ARTIFICIAL DATASETS (only sDNSs).
#Set percent difference between original and modified sequence (default 1 for species-level taxa, 3 for for supraspecific taxa).
Pdiff=

#Set proportion of sequences in the dataset to be modified (default 0.5 for species-level, and 0.1 for supraspecific taxa).
PrSeq=

#Set max number of sequences per taxon to modify (default 10)
NMaxSeq=

#Set threshold of sDNC rating(default stringent).
#100 artificial datasets are created to score the sDNC. If the sDNC remains diagnostic in  requested (defined by value of threshold),
#or higher number of artificial datasets in two consequtive runs, then sDNC is output. The threshold values are like:
#lousy: 66
#moderate: 75
#stringent: 90
#very_stringent: 95
